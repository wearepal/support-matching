# Fair distribution matching

Requires Python 3.6

# Installation
One of the dependencies is PyTorch. If your system is not compatible with the default torch installation 
(for example you require a specific CUDA installation), 
then please install this from [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/) as required. 
If so, it's recommended that you do this first.   

We have provided a setup.py file. To install this package, `pip install -e /path/to/this/dir`

# Running Experiments
Bash scripts to run the experiments from the paper are located in the `scripts` directory.
e.g. `bash scripts/adult/missing_1group_ranking.sh`
